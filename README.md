To create GitHub documentation for your project, you can follow these steps:

### Project Title: Real vs Fake Face Detection with Explainability

#### Project Description:
This project utilizes deep learning models to classify whether an input image contains a real or fake face. It also provides explainability by highlighting areas of the image that contribute most to the model's prediction.

#### Technologies Used:
- Python
- PyTorch
- Gradio
- facenet_pytorch
- pytorch-grad-cam
- NumPy
- OpenCV

#### Directory Structure:
```
- /images
  - /real_images
  - /fake_images
- model.py
- predict.py
- requirements.txt
- README.md
```

#### Code Files:
1. `model.py`: Contains the model architecture and training script.
2. `predict.py`: Implements the prediction function using the trained model.
3. `requirements.txt`: Lists all dependencies for easy environment setup.

#### Instructions to Run:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/real-vs-fake-face-detection.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd real-vs-fake-face-detection`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the prediction interface: `python predict.py`
5. Upload an image and see the classification result along with the explainability visualization.

#### Documentation:
- **Usage**: Upload an image to the interface and see if it contains a real or fake face.
- **Output**: The interface displays the classification label (real or fake) along with an explainability visualization highlighting the regions contributing to the model's prediction.
- **Saving**: Flagged images are saved in separate directories (`/real_images` and `/fake_images`) based on the prediction.
- **Confidence Scores**: Confidence scores for both real and fake predictions are displayed.

#### Emojis:
Include emojis in the README.md file to make it visually appealing and engaging. For example:
- ‚öôÔ∏è for technologies used
- üìÅ for directory structure
- üöÄ for instructions
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è for documentation

Feel free to customize and expand this documentation according to your project's specific details and requirements!
